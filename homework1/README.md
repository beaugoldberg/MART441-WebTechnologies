3. Homework Overview

    I was very happy to get started in this course with a homework like this becuase I really fell in love
    with website design and creation last semester. I was a little suprised for this homework given that it
    was stated like this was to be a review but many of the design options that you recommended for the site 
    design were all new to me. I had experimented quite a bit with some responsiveness design over the winter
    break but when I looked at the google reference sheet that was linked there were many new techniques that
    I hadnt been introduced to yet. I was excited to learn these and see what I could do with them. 

    The hero image took me a little bit to understand in how it needed to be setup and when I went to create
    my site I wanted several pictures to be able to be scrolled through. I settled for two when i determined that 
    the default hero image can be hidden behind the cover image and then it is shown when scrolling down. I tried
    to figure out how I would implement this with seperate images for each container that is shown while maintaining
    the parallax scrolling but wasnt able to come to a conclusion quite yet. I feel like you would just have to set 
    up the modules with their own images prior and then return to the initial image at the end but Im not sure (or
    using Javascript is likely the way to go). 

    I worked with break points or media tags during the break so I was able to handle those fine. I love the way 
    that they can change a site so easily for the different sizes but I do feel its slightly inefficient to have 
    to make a new media tag several times and create several designs. You do what you got to do i guess!

    Overall the homework went very smoothly and I was happy to jump right back in and learn some new things on 
    homework 1. I feel like im going to learn a lot over the course of this course and hope to be on the way to 
    making unique and highly interactive websites by the end of the course.
