                <h1>My Journey to Media Arts</h1>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was little I've been fascinated with learning. This fascination seems to have no bounds in that 
                    it spans through all known facets of knowledge for the most part. I've been profoundly fascinated by the unknowns
                    in the world which is the main motivation as to why I went to school initially for physics. This fascination with the
                    unknown has also mainfested itself into a desire to discover the unknown in relation to people (us) rather then objects of matter as in physics.
                    One rather unexpected manifestation of the unknown was my desire to explore it creatively. I'm constently throwing ideas around in my head whether
                    it be a unique way I can explore the unknowns of our world creatively or a unique way in which I can create something that hasn't been seen before.
                    I don't mean this to be seen as some profound creation, simply creating a unique story or experience is all that I'm after, but that desire is what lead
                    me to the study of Media Arts. In this next chapter in my life I'm hoping to gather skills that allow me to bring my creative works to life.

                <h1>My Greatest Strength</h1>
                <p>
                    I believe that my greatest strength is my never-ending desire for knowledge. That desire is the foundation for my motivation in my different pursuits 
                    in life. I see this as a strength because in anything that I do I am always on the hunt for how I can improve and create uniqueness in my works. This is beneficial
                    not only because it motivates me to learn new techniques and strategies I may not have known before, but it inspires me to use my newfound knowledge to create something
                    others may not have thought of before. It allows me to be on a constant trek of improvement while allowing my creative side to flourish. I hope to use this 
                    motivation in all of my future endeavors to learn and create as much as possible in my life.
