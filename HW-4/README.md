3. Homework Overview

    I had fun with this project. Many of the basics was review for me and I had messed around
    with using javascript to change the scene with events. I didnt really struggle with anything
    but I played a lot with the placement for the pug because I thought it was funny to put it in 
    different places. I enjoyed using the new functionality that javascript gives the user in 
    building the interactive site.
